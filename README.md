# Route-Cipher-Online

Could not find the textbook's implemetation of Transposition  Cipher - route cipher. This is an implement that matches the defination there. 
The best part: It uses py-script, the actual compute is in Python. The language we use in the couse, yay!! Web Assembly FTW!

### Considerations

Since this is a WASM thing, browser will not allow it loading local files. To develop locally, this needs to be hosted. If on VSCode, install the "live preview" extension and then serve the index.html file.

### ToDo

- Clean up the code. Wrote this in a evening, need more time. 
- Write Test cases for the python section.
